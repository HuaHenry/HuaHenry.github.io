abstract: >-
  This paper introduces Turing Machine Imitation Learning (TAIL), a synthetic chain-of-thought training framework that enhances the length generalization of large language models on computable reasoning tasks by imitating Turing Machine execution, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse algorithmic benchmarks.
